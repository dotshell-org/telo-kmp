/**
 * Computes the [Profile] that goes into every outgoing [Message].
 *
 * The profile is **derived locally** from data that never leaves the device:
 *  - `usage_status`: bucketed count of sessions in the trailing 30 days.
 *  - `habitual_lines`: top 5 lines used across trips in the trailing 30 days, sorted by frequency.
 *
 * Bucketing thresholds (from the plan §3.5):
 *   sessions < 5  → "occasional"
 *   sessions < 20 → "regular"
 *   else          → "intensive"
 *
 * If there is no local history yet (fresh install or after a wipe), the profile is the safe
 * default `{ "occasional", [] }`.
 *
 * Note on completeness:
 *  - `linesUsed` per trip is populated in Vague 4 once the [TripDetector] is online.
 *  - Until then, `habitual_lines` will be empty even for active users. That is acceptable:
 *    the field is documented as best-effort.
